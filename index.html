                    <p>Our garments are made from the softest rayons. Each garment is unique, and should be handled with
                        the utmost care. Please treat our garments gently and hand-wash in cold water. DO NOT MACHINE
                        WASH OR TUMBLE DRY. Please keep in mind that the rayon texture will contract when damp, and may
                        appear slightly smaller after washing. A warm garment steamer will relax the fabric after
                        washing, returning the garment to its original size and softness!</p>
